1. About
========

Predicate is a database connectivity and creation library,
a new iteration of KexiDB library developed within Kexi [1],
part of the Calligra Suite [2] (formerly KOffice).

It is consisted of a C++ Qt-only library and set of plugins.
Because there is no dependency on Kexi, Calligra or even on KDE libraries,
Predicate is available for wider audience. Kexi will use it too, thus
deprecating KexiDB.
