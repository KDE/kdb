Predicate CHANGELOG

2010-04-28
*merge kexidb r1119294
*MySQL Driver: Fix "DB created but cannot open" error appearing on creating a new database for mysql backend.
 See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html (complex!) for logic of otherwise simple thing.
 The solution is to execute SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_table_name' to get the flag and make the table and database names lowercase if needed.

2010-04-24
*merge kexidb r1116241:
**fix possible crash when adding two or more new columns to a table at once

**rename typedefs to use Const when needed

2010-01-31
SQLite (merged with kexidb)
*kexisql updated to 3.6.22
**we're still embedding sqlite in Kexi because of many options that are not set in distros, e.g. SECURE DELETE should be on by default http://sqlite.org/compile.html#secure_delete
**moved to amalgamation version for efficiency http://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html - makes it run faster
**moved directly to the SQLite driver - even more efficiency
**SQlite: "use database" operation no longer attempts to create new database if missing

2010-01-26
Queries (merged with kexidb)
*fixed memory ownership issues with data structures for ORDER BY in select queries
**this fixes generation of ORDER BY section of SQL statements
*improved debug of ORDER BY columns
