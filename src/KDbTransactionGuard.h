/**
 * @brief KDbTransactionGuard class is a convenience class that simplifies handling transactions
 *
 * KDbTransactionGuard can be used in two ways:
 * - start a new transaction in constructor and call commit or allow to rollback on destruction,
 * - use already started transaction and call commit or allow to rollback on destruction.
 *
 * In either case if the guarded transaction is committed or rolled back outside the
 * KDbTransactionGuard object in the meantime, nothing happens on KDbTransactionGuard's destruction.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <code>
 *  void MyClass::myMethod()
 *  {
 *    KDbTransaction transaction = connection->beginTransaction();
 *    KDbTransactionGuard tg(transaction);
 *    // <-- Some code that operates within the transaction here
 *    if (failure_condition)
 *      return; // After this return tg will be destroyed; connection->rollbackTransaction()
 *              // will be called automatically
 *    // success_condition:
 *    tg.commit();
 *    // Now tg won't do anything because transaction no longer exists
 *  }
 * </code>
