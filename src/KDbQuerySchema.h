     so this method does the work for you.

     If @a options is Unique, each field is returned in the vector only once
     (first found field is selected).
     Note however, that the same field can be returned more than once if it has attached
     a different alias.
     For example, let t be TABLE( a, b ) and let query be defined
     by "SELECT *, a AS alfa FROM t" statement. Both fieldsExpanded(Default)
     and fieldsExpanded(Unique) will return [ a, b, a (alfa) ] list.
     On the other hand, for query defined by "SELECT *, a FROM t" statement,
     fieldsExpanded(Default) will return [ a, b, a ] list while
     fieldsExpanded(Unique) will return [ a, b ] list.

     If @a options is WithInternalFields or WithInternalFieldsAndRecordID,
     additional internal fields are also appended to the vector.

     If @a options is WithInternalFieldsAndRecordId,
     one fake BigInteger column is appended to make space for Record ID column used
     by KDbCursor implementations. For example, let persons be TABLE( surname, city_id ),
     let city_number reference cities.is in TABLE cities( id, name ) and let query q be defined
     by "SELECT * FROM t" statement. If we want to display persons' city names instead of city_id's.
     To do this, cities.name has to be retrieved as well, so the following statement should be used:
     "SELECT * FROM persons, cities.name LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON persons.city_id=cities.id".
     Thus, calling fieldsExpanded(WithInternalFieldsAndRecordId) will return 4 elements instead of 2:
     persons.surname, persons.city_id, cities.name, {ROWID}. The {ROWID} item is the placeholder
     used for fetching ROWID by KDb cursors.

     By default, all fields are returned in the vector even
     if there are multiple occurrences of one or more (options == Default).

     Note: You should assign the resulted vector in your space - it will be shared
     and implicity copied on any modification.
     This method's result is cached by KDbQuerySchema object.

     - If @a options is UnexpandedList, each KDbQueryColumnInfo pointer is mapped to the index

       is mapped to the index within (unexpanded) list of columns that come from asterisks

     - If @a options is ExpandedList (the default) this method provides is exactly opposite
       information compared to vector returned by fieldsExpanded().

     This method's result is cached by the KDbQuerySchema object.
     Note: indices of internal fields (see internalFields()) are also returned
     here - in this case the index is counted as a sum of size(e) + i (where "e" is
     the list of expanded fields and i is the column index within internal fields list).
     This feature is used eg. at the end of KDbConnection::updateRecord() where need indices of
     fields (including internal) to update all the values in memory.

     Example use: let t be table (int id, name text, surname text) and q be query
     defined by a statement "select * from t".

     - columnsOrder(ExpandedList) will return the following map: KDbQueryColumnInfo(id)->0,
       KDbQueryColumnInfo(name)->1, KDbQueryColumnInfo(surname)->2.
     - columnsOrder(UnexpandedList) will return the following map: KDbQueryColumnInfo(id)->0,
       KDbQueryColumnInfo(name)->0, KDbQueryColumnInfo(surname)->0 because the column
       list is not expanded. This way you can use the returned index to get KDbField*
       pointer using field(uint) method of KDbFieldList superclass.
     - columnsOrder(UnexpandedListWithoutAsterisks) will return the following map:
       KDbQueryColumnInfo(id)->0,

     Indexing is performed against vector returned by fieldsExpanded().
     It is usable for e.g. Conenction::updateRecord(), when we need

     Returned vector is owned and cached by KDbQuerySchema object. When you assign it,
     it is implicity shared. Its size is equal to number of primary key
     fields defined for master table (masterTable()->primaryKey()->fieldCount()).

       primary key's field in the fieldsExpanded() list.
     - can be equal to -1 if there is no such primary key's field
       in the fieldsExpanded() list.

     If there are more than one primary key's field included in the query,
     only first-found column (oin the fieldsExpanded() list) for each pkey's field is included.

     -# The query defined by "SELECT A, ID2 FROM T" statement, and thus pkeyFieldCount()
        will return 1 (only one primary key's field is in the fieldsExpanded() list),
        and pkeyFieldsOrder() will return vector {-1, 1}, as second primary key's field
