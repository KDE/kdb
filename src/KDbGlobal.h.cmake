@brief High-level database connectivity library with database backend drivers

@section Framework
KDbDriverManager

Database access
 - KDbConnection
 - KDbConnectionData

Database structure
 - Schema
  - KDbTableSchema
  - KDbQuerySchema
  - KDbIndexSchema

Stored in the database.

Data representation
 - KDbRecord
 - KDbField

@section Drivers

Drivers are loaded using KDbDriverManager::driver(const QString& name).  The names
of drivers are given in their drivers .desktop file in the DriverName field.

KDb supports two kinds of databases: file-based and network-based databases.
The type of a driver is available from several places. The DriverType
field in the driver's .desktop file, is read by the KDbDriverManager and
available by calling KDbDriverManager::KDbDriverInfo(const QString &name) and using
the KDbDriverInfo#fileBased member from the result. Given a reference to a
driver, its type can also be found directly using KDbDriver::isFileBased().

Each database backend driver consists of three main classes: a driver,
a connection and a cursor class, e.g SQLiteDriver, SQLiteConnection,
SQLiteCursor.

The driver classes subclass the KDbDriver class.  They set KDbDriver#m_typeNames,
which maps KDb KDbField::Type on to the types supported by the database.  They also
provide functions for escaping strings and checking table names.  These may be
used, for example, on a database backend that uses the database name as a
filename.  In this case, it should be ensured that all the characters in the
database name are valid characters in a filename.

The connection classes subclass the KDbConnection class, and include most of the
calls to the native database API.

The cursor classes subclass KDbCursor, and implement cursor functionality specific
to the database backend.
