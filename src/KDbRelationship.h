#ifndef KDB_RELATIONSHIP_H

#include "KDbField.h"

/*! KDbRelationship provides information about one-to-many relationship between two tables.
 Relationship is defined by a pair of (potentially multi-field) indices:
 - "one" or "master" side: unique key
 - "many" or "details" side: referenced foreign key
 <pre>
 [unique key, master] ----< [foreign key, details]
 </pre>

 In this documentation, we will call table that owns fields of "one" side as
 "master side of the relationship", and the table that owns foreign key fields of
 as "details side of the relationship".
 Use masterTable(), and detailsTable() to get one-side table and many-side table, respectively.

 Note: some engines (e.g. MySQL with InnoDB) requires that indices at both sides
 have to be explicitly created.

 @todo (js) It is planned that this will be handled by KDb internally and transparently.

 Each (of the two) key can be defined (just like index) as list of fields owned by one table.
 Indeed, relationship info can retrieved from KDbRelationship object in two ways:
 -# pair of indices; use masterIndex(), detailsIndex() for that
 -# ordered list of field pairs (<master-side-field, details-side-field>); use fieldPairs() for that

 No assigned objects (like fields, indices) are owned by KDbRelationship object. The exception is that
 list of field-pairs is internally created (on demand) and owned.

 KDbRelationship object is owned by KDbIndexSchema object (the one that is defined at master-side of the
 relationship).
 Note also that KDbIndexSchema objects are owned by appropriate tables, so thus
 there is implicit ownership between KDbTableSchema and KDbRelationship.

 If KDbRelationship object is not attached to KDbIndexSchema object,
 you should care about destroying it by hand.

  Example:
  <pre>
            ----------
   ---r1--<|          |
           | Table A [uk]----r3---<
   ---r2--<|          |
            ----------
  </pre>
  Table A has two relationships (r1, r2) at details side and one (r3) at master side.
  [uk] stands for unique key.
