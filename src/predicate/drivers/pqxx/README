ReadMe For predicate libpqxx-based PostgreSQL Driver

This driver requires libpqxx available from pqxx.tk or gborg.postgresql.org.

Currently the driver builds against 1.9.4 of libpqxx, but it should always work with the latest version.
When 2.0.0 comes out then that will be the version to use.

The driver may require PostgreSQL >=7.4.  Using the old api this was a requirement, but the rewrite
isnt far enough in to get into those kinds of details, so at the mement it should be happy with earlier versions.
Im using PostgreSQL from CVS so i cant say for sure.

Thats it for now
