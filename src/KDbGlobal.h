@section Drivers

Drivers are loaded as plugins on demand by KDbDriverManager. The IDs, descriptions
and other details about drivers are given in their metadata by KDbDriverManager::driverMetaData().
The metadata is accessible without actually loading any driver.

KDb supports two families of databases, file and network-based while providing a single
uniform API.

Each database driver implements of three main classes KDbDriver, KDbConnection, KDbCursor.
The driver classes handle database-related specifics such as data types, naming and hide
them behind a general purpose API. The connection classes act as a proxy between the KDb API
and the native database. The cursor classes implement cursor functionality specific to
the native database at record level.
