0. Preface
----------
Below is definition (formal grammar and comments) for SQL used externally by KDb.
"Externally" means that this language is visible to the user and can be used
by her/him to define queries.

Many attempts has been done to create common part of many SQL versions that
are currently in everyday use, mainly:
- SQLite
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL


1.1 CREATE TABLE
----------------

<CREATE_TABLE> ::= CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
                   <field_def>[,<field_def>]*
                   [,<table_constraint>]*
                   )
<field_def> ::= <field_name> <field_type> <field_constraint>

Note
----
CREATE TABLE statement could be added to KDbSQL for advanced users convenience,
although tables can be easier created with gui. CREATE TABLE for KDb has
non-standard KDb-specific options.
