1. predicatefeaturestest
-------------

This is a set of tests for the Predicate library API.
Every test is driver-independent.

Usage: run 'predicatefeaturestest --help' for usage details.


2. sqltest
----------

A script for easier executing 'parser' subtest within te predicatefeaturestest.
Usage: run './sqltest' without arguments for usage details.

There is also sqltest_int script accepting interactive mode.
Usage: run './sqltest_int' without arguments for usage details.

4. Information for Predicate drivers developers
--------------------------------------------
FIXME: update

While you're developing a new driver or plan to improve existing one,
you may want to test a number of aspects of the Predicate library to see
if the behaviour is like expected.

Following tests should be passed (the order is from most simple 
test to more complicated):

-dbcreation
-schema
-tables
-cursors
-tableview (note: it is disabled as Predicate is largely non-gui for now)
-parser
-dr_prop

If a given driver does not pass one of these tests, and you have found that:
- the problem is apparently on the Predicate library side (e.g. crash, or improper
behaviour),
- the problem can be solved by extending the Predicate API,
- the documentation is not correct or not clear enough, or
- whatever like that...
